## MVP

-   Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
-   Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

    -   translate their English text into Morse Code
    -   Morse Code into English text

-   Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
-   Bonus:

    -   Handle other characters as well (done)
    -   Detect if a piece of text is english or morse and translate accordingly

-   Split your code between data, logic functions and dom functions
-   Develop unit tests for all of your logic functions
-   Explore and discover edge cases in your code to further develop your tests
